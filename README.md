###### **EGG TIMER BOT**
Uses the discord.py package to write a simple discord bot.

The bot listens for messages in the channels it is connected to and if any
message contains the word "hurry", displays an annoying message.

The bot joins the "General" voice channel in a guild and plays an annoying ticking sound.
